character sizing:
  - apply if we can apply CSS to the enemies, then we can easily make them animated (i think), which would make stretch idea 1 not that hard.
  - i think normal characters should be around 15 lines long,
    boss characters should probably be bigger than normal characters
  - For Our Bacteriopage (the user), i think we should display the users name ontop/below where the user is displayed in combat, as well as enemy name
  - normal Enemies should have around 12 tabs in order for them to be spaced properly in combat sequences.

  - this will probably end up being a stretch idea but ideally we should display the enemies health along with the users health via a health bar
    (ie [============================ 100% ===============================])
stretch ideas:
  - after an attack is made, display animation of attack occurring.
    for this idea, i think that when combat is triggered, the terminal window should be resized to x size that would display
    the ascii so that only one "frame" is displayed in the window at a time.
